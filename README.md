# The Monolith Language

## Futures
* Fast compilation
* Perfomance (within 3-4% of C)
* Safety: no null, no global, no UB (Undefined Behavior)
* Translation from Monolith to C
* Easy cross platform compilation (Linux, Windows, MacOS, BSD)

First version of Monolith plan release for February 2019. Right now Monolith in alpha stage.
